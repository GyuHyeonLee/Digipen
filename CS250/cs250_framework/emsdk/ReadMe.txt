This platform uses Emscripten to make web builds.

You can get it from here: 
http://kripken.github.io/emscripten-site/docs/getting_started/downloads.html

I recommend using a portable version.

The make files assume that em++ is in the path, so before calling them you just need to run emsdk_env.bat or emsdk_env.sh
